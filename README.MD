# Rclone Google Drive sync scripts

As Google insist on forget about linux users, we have to use alternative ways to use Google Drive.

This scripts use [rclone]() to make specific folder of Google Drive Available locally.

Before attempting to use read the documentation of [rclone]().

Make sure to use `--resync` on the first run. I strongly suggest that you also try the scripts with a test folder or use `--dry-run`.
